# aws-data-pipeline-deployment
This repository contains code for an AWS data pipeline project that reads data from S3 and pushes it to RDS or Glue. It uses Docker for containerization, Jenkins for CI/CD, and Terraform for provisioning AWS resources. The pipeline includes Docker image deployment to ECR and a Lambda function using this image.
